# maids_cc_alaa_awad_test

A new Flutter project test for maids cc company , programming by eng Alaa Awad

## Getting Started

work in any deceive android and work in windows
I didn't store the data locally because I didn't have enough time.
I conducted uint tests for some units.
I didn't fully understand the third point, but I added it to the program based on what I understood.
I Used Bloc as state management and used dio package to get data from server
Actually, the server doesn't add, delete, or modify items. This caused me problems at the beginning until I discovered that. So,
I created a simple simulation to align the interface with the changes and commands.
Of course, the program needs significant improvement in terms of interfaces and some modifications,
but I didn't have enough time :)
And thank you for taking the time to review the code.
